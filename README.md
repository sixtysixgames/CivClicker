# CivClicker
Yet another fork of CivClicker
This one is from https://github.com/depressivecherry/civ-clicker

In my quest to find world conquest games like the famous Sid Meiers' Civilization I found this little game that can be played on a browser
http://civclicker.sourceforge.net/civclicker/civclicker.html

And I looked into it and I found this other version with a better interface
http://deathraygames.com/play-online/civ-clicker/

And this one with a better conquest feature
https://depressivecherry.github.io/civ-clicker/

Further investigation revealed that it's built with just Javascript and html, and it's open-source, which means anyone can take the code and change it as they wish

So here is my version...
